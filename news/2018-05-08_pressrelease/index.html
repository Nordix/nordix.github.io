<p>Stockholm – 8th of May, 2018 - Today Nordix Foundation is announced, a Nordic open source foundation with the objective to enable more companies and organizations in the region to leverage open source across entire digital environments. Nordix Foundation will provide an open source network for sharing of knowledge, expertise, training and code. </p>

<p>The foundation is established as a direct response to corporations and organizations expressing a need to increase their knowledge about open source innovation in order to enhance their abilities to successfully use and develop open source projects in their digital transformations.</p>

<p>Founding members of the organization, that in the spirit of open source will be a non-profit and democratic organization, are some of the leading forces within open source in the Nordic countries including; Ericsson Software Technology (EST), infrastructure cloud provider City Network, Blekinge Institute of Technology (BTH), IT Monitoring Software Solutions company OP5 and PacketFront Software, maker of network orchestration software.</p>

<p>“In order to innovate the best applications and run it on a flexible and scalable platform, companies across the Nordic region are increasingly leveraging open source. At the same time, many organizations are still hesitant to go the open way because of lack of knowledge and support. With Nordix Foundation, we want to address these issues and enable Nordic companies to take the same advantages as organizations in the US and Asia where open source is a natural part in all innovation”, says Johan Christenson, founding member of Nordix Foundation and CEO of City Network.</p>

<p>“Across the Nordics, we have some extremely talented developers and there are many examples of innovative companies disrupting business models and creating new large corporations. Establishing Nordix Foundation to further this innovation and enable the acceleration of new technologies at a global scale is important for our region”, says Christopher Price, founding member of Nordix Foundation and Head of Ericsson Software Technology.</p>

<p>The program and specific initiatives that Nordix Foundation will focus on will be agreed upon by participating members where the foundation acts as a framework providing the international connection to other open source organizations, webinars, events and meetings.</p>
